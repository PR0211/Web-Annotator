In this annotation I have added multiple features to annotate webpage.
The user can highlight contents on the webpage with styles and notes added to them for future reference.
The user have an option to choose the highlight color for the selected content on webpage,can apply styles to the highlighted content like bold,italic and underline.
There are options to search/filter annotations based on keyword,date and styles.
There is an option to retrieve highlights which retrieve all the previously made annotation on that page with their styles and notes intact and applies it to the webpage.
There are shortcut keys present for each option on the extension for efficient annotation and ease navigation within the extension.(shortcut keys can be be found when a user hovers on button)
